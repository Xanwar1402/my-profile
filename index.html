				  	<h2>Football</h2>
				  	<p>I love football, I used to play this game for 10 years as a fullback. My favorite team is Paris-Saint-Germain, and my favorite football player is Paul Pogba because of his greatness in the game and his mentality.

				  	<h2>Cars</h2>
				  	<p>I am fund of cars. Every type of cars, old ones of sport cars or supercars. My favorites are the Chevrolet Corvette C8 Stingray and the McLaren 765 LT. I did a pilot training last summer and I enjoyed it because it was a new for me and now, I want to do some races thanks to the training.

				  	<h2>Wine</h2>
				  	<p>Also, I am passionate of wine because I am from Burgundy. I tasted different types of wine, and my favorite is the red wine from Vosne-Romanée in the Nuit’s coast. But also, I tried the wine from different regions, and they were good too.

				  	<h2>Music & Rap</h2>
				  	<p>I like the music and my favorite type of music is the French rap. My favorites singers are Nekfeu, Ninho, Kaneki and Guizmo. But I also like the US rap but the old school one like 50 cent or Eminem because the vibe is totally different of what we have now.
